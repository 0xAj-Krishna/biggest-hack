## 📝 What happened
In early 2023, Oracle released a patch for a critical **remote code execution** vulnerability in **WebLogic Server**.  
The flaw existed in the **IIOP/T3 protocol** handling, which allowed attackers to send malicious serialized objects.  
This resulted in arbitrary code execution on vulnerable WebLogic servers without authentication.  
Attackers used the flaw to deploy ransomware and crypto-mining malware in enterprise environments.  

---

## 💥 Impact
- Full remote takeover of WebLogic servers.  
- Ransomware groups leveraged the flaw to disrupt business operations.  
- Widely exploited in real-world attacks shortly after disclosure.  

---

## 🔑 Lesson learned
- Middleware platforms like WebLogic are high-value targets.  
- Deserialization remains a recurring critical bug class.  
- Rapid patching cycles must be enforced for enterprise software.  

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation / Recommendation
- Apply Oracle’s Critical Patch Update (CPU) for WebLogic immediately.  
- Restrict access to WebLogic admin consoles.  
- Monitor for unusual processes or network traffic.  
- Segment middleware servers from critical internal systems.
