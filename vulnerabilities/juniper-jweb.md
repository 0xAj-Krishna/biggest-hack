## 📝 What happened
This section explains the discovery, exploitation method, and technical flow of the vulnerability.  
Hackers identified flaws in software logic, authentication bypass, or unsafe coding practices.  
Many were exploited as **zero-days**, meaning attackers used them before patches were released.  
Some were **supply-chain attacks** (like XZ Utils), others were **remote code execution flaws** in appliances (like Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco).  
All cases show how critical infrastructure software can be turned into an attacker’s entry point.  

---

## 💥 Impact
- Organizations worldwide were targeted.  
- Attackers deployed ransomware, stole sensitive data, and planted long-term backdoors.  
- Some incidents affected **hundreds of companies at once** (MOVEit, Citrix Bleed).  
- Government agencies issued emergency directives in several cases.  

---

## 🔑 Lessons learned
- Patch management and monitoring must prioritize **edge-facing devices** (VPNs, firewalls).  
- **Supply-chain trust** cannot rely on a single maintainer.  
- **Zero-trust security** should extend to appliances and collaboration platforms.  
- Security testing (fuzzing, code audits) is critical for widely deployed software.  

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation / Recommendation
- Apply vendor patches and advisories immediately.  
- Rebuild or rotate credentials after compromise.  
- Restrict internet exposure of management interfaces.  
- Use **defense-in-depth**: WAFs, segmentation, MFA, and anomaly detection.  
- For open-source, enforce **reproducible builds** and multi-party code review.
